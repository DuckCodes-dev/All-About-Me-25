    About Me
</h1>
<p class="title">
    This webpage is about me; Cole Bergeron. 
    It will cover things like my background and family, as well as my interests and hobbies.
</p>
<h2>
    My Background And Family
</h2>
<p>
    To start off, on my father's side is my French and Irish background. 
    Primarily being French and most family being in Quebec, I used to live there about one year ago, more of that later. 
    On my mother's side I have the English and Scottish side of my family. 
    Although it is primarily English more than Scottish. 
    Fun detail, we don't know of which of the Douglas clans our family came from in Scottland, as there's either the Red Douglas clan or the Black Douglas clan.
